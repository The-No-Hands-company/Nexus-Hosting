# Federated Hosting

A production-grade **federated website hosting service** where users deploy static sites and independent nodes form a cryptographically verified network. No single company controls the infrastructure — anyone can run a node.

## What is Federated Hosting?

Federated Hosting lets users:

1. **Log in** via Replit Auth (OpenID Connect)
2. **Upload** website files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, fonts) to object storage
3. **Deploy** their site — gets a unique domain, version-tracked, atomically committed
4. **Replicate** — the deploy is automatically mirrored to all active federation peers via signed `site_sync` events
5. **Serve** — any node in the network can serve any site, routed by host header

Independent operators run nodes. Each node has an **Ed25519 cryptographic identity**, participates in the federation protocol, and can host and replicate sites for the network.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 24+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm 10+](https://pnpm.io/)
- PostgreSQL database (connection string in `DATABASE_URL`)
- Replit object storage (or S3-compatible store)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-No-Hands-company/Federated-Hosting.git
cd Federated-Hosting
pnpm install
```

### Environment Variables

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname
DEFAULT_OBJECT_STORAGE_BUCKET_ID=your-bucket-id
PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR=private
PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS=public
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Database Setup

```bash
# Push schema to database (creates all tables and indexes)
pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push
```

### Development

```bash
# Start everything concurrently
pnpm run dev

# Or start individually:
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev     # API on :8080
pnpm --filter @workspace/federated-hosting run dev  # Frontend on :25231
```

### Build

```bash
pnpm run build
```

## Features

### Phase 1 — Auth + File Serving
- Replit Auth (OIDC + PKCE) — users own their sites
- Presigned URL upload flow to object storage
- Host-header site serving — `your-domain.com` routes to the right files
- My Sites dashboard + drag-and-drop deploy UI

### Phase 2 — Federation Protocol
- **Ed25519 key pairs** — each node has a cryptographic identity
- **`/.well-known/federation`** discovery endpoint
- **Signed handshakes** — nodes verify each other's identity before peering
- **Federation event log** — persistent record of all handshakes, pings, syncs
- Deploy → automatic replication to all active peers

### Phase 3 — Subdomain Routing + Replication
- Host-header routing middleware — serves any registered site domain
- Per-node capacity API — storage stats, site counts, bandwidth
- Auto-initialises local node with Ed25519 keys on startup
- Network-wide capacity overview

### Phase 4 — Production Hardening
- Helmet (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Rate limiting — 200 req/min global; 20 req/min on auth/upload
- Gzip compression
- Structured pino logging with request IDs (X-Request-ID)
- `AppError` class + `asyncHandler` — clean error propagation
- Global error handler — structured JSON errors, no stack traces in prod
- DB transactions on deploy — atomic, never partial
- Database indexes on all hot query paths
- Graceful shutdown — drains connections on SIGTERM/SIGINT
- React `ErrorBoundary` — friendly fallback UI on crashes
- Auto-retry with exponential backoff; no retries on 4xx
