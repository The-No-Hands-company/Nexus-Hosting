## Remaining Gaps (Honest — March 2026)

### Category 1 — Core Platform

| Gap | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Billing / payment processing | N/A | FedHost is free. Donations only. No tiers, no Stripe. |
| Email verification enforced on deploys | MEDIUM | ⚠️ Email sent on login; unverified users can still deploy |
| Malware scanning on upload | HIGH | ❌ No ClamAV hook or content scanning |
| CDN integration | LOW | ❌ Not built |

### Category 2 — Federation Maturity

| Gap | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical external seed node list | HIGH | ❌ A fresh node has no peers to start from |
| Dynamic site federation | MEDIUM | ❌ NLPL/Node state/env/DB not replicated |
| Node trust score in federation UI | LOW | ⚠️ DB table exists; not surfaced in frontend |

### Category 3 — Security

| Gap | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CIDR-range IP bans in middleware | MEDIUM | ⚠️ Schema supports it; only exact IP checked |
| Rust proxy per-domain rate limiting shared | MEDIUM | ⚠️ In-memory per-proxy-instance only |

### Category 4 — Operator Experience

| Gap | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Upgrade runbook | HIGH | ❌ Not written |
| Incident response runbook | MEDIUM | ❌ Not written |
| `@fedhost/cli` published to npm | LOW | ❌ Not published |

- [ ] Object storage verified (S3/R2/MinIO bucket accessible)
- [ ] Migrations applied on production DB
- [ ] Load test: 100 req/s sustained 1 hour, p99 < 150ms
- [ ] `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on hot DB paths
- [ ] CDN in front of Caddy
- [ ] 2+ API server instances verified (session sharing via Redis)
- [ ] Federation sync reliability test: node downtime + recovery
- [ ] Email delivery tested end-to-end
- [ ] Abuse report flow tested end-to-end (submit → admin review → takedown)
- [ ] Build cache dir (`BUILD_CACHE_DIR`) on a persistent volume
